# LSGangSystem

LSGangSystem is a custom GTA V mod that allows players to recruit random NPCs (peds) to form their own gang. Once recruited, gang members will follow the player, defend against attackers, and assist in combat. The mod brings a feature reminiscent of the gang system from GTA: San Andreas, adding a tactical layer to gameplay.

``` Currently, the mod is under development with key features like recruitment, defense mechanics, and NPC interaction already implemented. Future updates will focus on refining behavior, adding new commands, and enhancing NPC AI for a more immersive gang experience. ```
